//goal->setup the supabase for gmails, then I discovered that I have changed the url only(to supabase have free plan for emails so no need in smtp)
me:I am building a React + Vite + TypeScript app using Supabase Auth with Magic Link
Give me exact Supabase dashboard instructions to enable Email provider and set redirect URL to http://localhost:5173


I'll help you set up Supabase Auth with Magic Link for your React + Vite + TypeScript app. Here are the exact steps to configure your Supabase dashboard:
Supabase Dashboard Configuration Steps
1. Enable Email Provider
Go to your Supabase Dashboard
Select your project
Navigate to Authentication → Providers in the left sidebar
Find Email in the providers list
Toggle the Enable switch to turn on Email authentication
Make sure Enable email confirmations is checked (this is required for Magic Links)
2. Configure Redirect URLs
In the same Authentication section, click on URL Configuration in the left sidebar
In the Site URL field, enter: http://localhost:5173
In the Redirect URLs section, add: http://localhost:5173
Click Save to apply the changes
3. Additional Magic Link Settings (Optional but Recommended)
Still in Authentication → Providers → Email
You can customize the Template if you want to modify the email content
The default template works well for most use cases
4. Get Your Project Credentials
Go to Settings → API in the left sidebar
Copy your Project URL and anon public key
These will be used in your supabase.ts configuration file
Important Notes:
The redirect URL http://localhost:5173 is the default Vite development server port
Make sure to add production URLs to the redirect list when you deploy
Magic Links will automatically redirect users back to your app after they click the email link
The redirect URL should match exactly what you have in your app's authentication flow
After completing these steps, your Supabase project will be configured to handle Magic Link authentication for your React app running on http://localhost:5173.
. Enable Email Provider

I dont have "Providers" in the left sidebar 
I navigated to authentication and then I saw in the left sidebar gmails, do I have navigate there? if yes tell me what next


chat: Yes, you're in the right place! The "Gmail" or "Email" section you see is exactly where you need to go. The interface might look slightly different depending on your Supabase version, but here's what to do:
Next Steps:
1. Click on "Gmail" or "Email" in the left sidebar
This will take you to the email provider configuration page.
2. Enable Email Authentication
Look for a toggle switch or checkbox labeled "Enable" or "Enable Email Provider"
Turn this ON
3. Enable Email Confirmations
Find the setting for "Enable email confirmations" or "Require email confirmation"
Make sure this is checked/ON (this is essential for Magic Links to work)
4. Configure Redirect URLs
Look for a section called "Redirect URLs" or "Site URL"
Add http://localhost:5173 to the list
If there's a "Site URL" field, enter http://localhost:5173 there too
5. Save Changes
Look for a "Save" or "Update" button and click it
Alternative Navigation Path:
If you don't see the email settings in the Gmail section, try:
Go to Authentication → Settings (instead of Providers)
Look for "Email Templates" or "Email Configuration"
Or check Authentication → Configuration
The key is finding where you can enable email authentication and set the redirect URL to http://localhost:5173. Let me know what you see in the Gmail/Email section and I can guide you through the specific options available there.
